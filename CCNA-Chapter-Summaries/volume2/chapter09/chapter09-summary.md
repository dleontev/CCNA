# Chapter 9: Security Architectures

## Foundation Topics

### Security Terminology

*   **Vulnerability:** A weakness that can be exploited to compromise security. 
*   **Exploit:** A tool or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability. 
*   **Threat:** The potential for someone to use an exploit to take advantage of a vulnerability. 
*   **Mitigation:** Measures taken to counteract or prevent threats and malicious activity. 

### Common Security Threats

*   **Malware:** Malicious software that can infect computers and networks. 
*   **Phishing:** An attack technique that uses deceptive emails or websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information. 
*   **Social Engineering:** An attack that exploits human trust and social behaviors to gain unauthorized access or information. 
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attacks that aim to disrupt network services by overwhelming them with traffic. 

## Attacks That Spoof Addresses

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attacks that can use spoofed IP addresses to flood a target system with traffic, preventing legitimate users from accessing services. 
*   **Reflection and Amplification Attacks:** Attacks that use third-party servers to amplify the amount of traffic directed at a target, often using spoofed IP addresses to hide the attacker's identity. 
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attacks that intercept communications between two parties to eavesdrop or manipulate data, often using spoofed IP or MAC addresses to redirect traffic. 

## Reconnaissance Attacks

*   **Reconnaissance attacks** gather information about a target network or system to identify vulnerabilities and plan further attacks. 
*   Examples include:
    *   Ping sweeps 
    *   Port scans 
    *   Vulnerability scans 

## Buffer Overflow Attacks

*   **Buffer overflow attacks** exploit vulnerabilities in software to overwrite memory and execute malicious code. 

## Malware

*   **Malware** is malicious software that can infect computers and networks. 
*   Examples include:
    *   Viruses 
    *   Worms 
    *   Trojans 
    *   Ransomware 

## Human Vulnerabilities

*   Humans can be vulnerable to social engineering and phishing attacks, which exploit trust and psychological manipulation to gain unauthorized access or information. 

### Password Vulnerabilities

*   Weak or reused passwords can be easily compromised through guessing, dictionary attacks, or brute-force attacks. 

### Password Alternatives

*   **Multi-factor authentication:** Requires users to provide multiple factors of authentication, such as something they know (password), something they have (token), or something they are (biometric), to increase security. 
*   **Biometrics:** Uses unique biological traits, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, to authenticate users. 

## Controlling and Monitoring User Access

*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Rules configured on network devices to control traffic flow and user access based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. 
*   **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA):** A framework for managing user access by verifying identities, determining permissions, and tracking activities. 

## Developing a Security Program to Educate Users

*   A security program should include user awareness, training, and physical access control to educate users about security threats, best practices, and company policies. 

## Chapter Review

*   This chapter covered security terminology, common threats, address spoofing attacks, reconnaissance attacks, buffer overflow attacks, malware, human vulnerabilities, password vulnerabilities, password alternatives, controlling and monitoring user access, and developing a security program to educate users.
