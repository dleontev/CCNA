# Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Wireless Networks

## Comparing Wired and Wireless Networks

*   Wired networks use cables to connect devices, while wireless networks use radio waves. 
*   Wired networks are typically more secure and reliable than wireless networks, but they are also less flexible and convenient. 
*   Wireless networks are more flexible and convenient than wired networks, but they are also less secure and reliable. 

## Wireless LAN Topologies

### Basic Service Set

*   A basic service set (BSS) is a group of wireless devices that are served by a single access point (AP). 
*   The AP is responsible for managing the BSS and for forwarding traffic between the wireless devices and the wired network. 
*   The BSS is identified by a BSSID, which is the MAC address of the AP. 
*   The BSS is also identified by an SSID, which is a text string that is used to identify the wireless network. 

### Distribution System

*   The distribution system (DS) is the wired network that connects the AP to the rest of the network. 
*   The DS can be a single switch or a complex network of switches and routers. 
*   The AP acts as a bridge between the wireless network and the wired network. 

### Extended Service Set

*   An extended service set (ESS) is a group of BSSs that are connected together. 
*   The ESS is identified by an ESSID, which is the same SSID that is used by all of the BSSs in the ESS. 
*   Wireless clients can roam between BSSs in the ESS without losing their connection to the network. 

### Independent Basic Service Set

*   An independent basic service set (IBSS) is a group of wireless devices that are not connected to an AP. 
*   IBSSs are typically used for ad hoc networks, where devices need to communicate with each other directly. 

## Other Wireless Topologies

*   A repeater is a device that can be used to extend the range of a wireless network. 
*   A workgroup bridge is a device that can be used to connect a wired device to a wireless network. 
*   A mesh network is a network of APs that are connected together wirelessly. 

## Wireless Bands and Channels

*   Wireless LANs use two main frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. 
*   The 2.4 GHz band is more crowded than the 5 GHz band, but it also has a longer range. 
*   The 5 GHz band is less crowded than the 2.4 GHz band, but it also has a shorter range. 
*   Channels are used to divide the frequency bands into smaller segments. 
*   Nonoverlapping channels are channels that do not interfere with each other. 
*   In the 2.4 GHz band, only channels 1, 6, and 11 are nonoverlapping. 
*   In the 5 GHz band, all channels are nonoverlapping.
