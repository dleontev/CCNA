* **ad hoc wireless network:** A wireless network that does not require a central access point.
* **association request:** A message sent by a wireless client to an access point to request access to the network.
* **band:** A range of radio frequencies used for wireless communication. In the context of Wi-Fi, the two most common bands are 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
* **basic service set (BSS):** A group of wireless devices that are connected to a single access point.
* **Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID):** A unique identifier for a basic service set.
* **beacon:** A message broadcast by an access point to advertise its presence and availability.
* **cell:** The coverage area of an access point.
* **channel:** A specific frequency within a band that is used for wireless communication.
* **distribution system (DS):** A network of wired or wireless devices that connects multiple access points to each other.
* **extended service set (ESS):** A group of wireless devices that are connected to multiple access points through a distribution system.
* **Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID):** A unique identifier for an extended service set.
* **independent basic service set (IBSS):** A basic service set that does not have an access point.
* **infrastructure mode:** A wireless network that uses an access point.
* **mesh network:** A wireless network in which all nodes can act as both access points and clients.
* **nonoverlapping channels:** Channels that do not interfere with each other.
* **passive scanning:** The process of listening for beacon frames from access points to identify available networks.
* **point-to-point bridge:** A wireless device that connects two wireless networks together.
* **probe request:** A message sent by a wireless client to an access point to request information about the network.
* **reassociation request:** A message sent by a wireless client to an access point to request to rejoin the network after it has been disconnected.
* **repeater:** A wireless device that amplifies and retransmits wireless signals.
* **roaming:** The process of a wireless client automatically switching between access points as it moves around.
* **Service Set Identifier (SSID):** A name used to identify a wireless network.
* **station (STA):** A wireless client device.
* **workgroup bridge (WGB):** A wireless device that connects multiple wireless clients together without using an access point.
