# Chapter 18 Key Terms

*   **Layer 3 EtherChannel (L3 EtherChannel):** An EtherChannel that is configured to carry routed traffic. This allows for increased bandwidth and redundancy for routed links.
*   **Layer 3 switch:** A switch that can perform routing functions in addition to switching functions. This allows for more efficient routing of traffic between VLANs.
*   **multilayer switch:** Another term for a Layer 3 switch.
*   **routed port:** A physical port on a Layer 3 switch that is configured to act as a routed interface. Routed ports are not associated with a particular VLAN and can be used to connect to other routed devices, such as routers.
*   **router-on-a-stick (ROAS):** A configuration where a router has a single interface connected to a trunk port on a switch. Subinterfaces are then used on the router to route traffic between VLANs.
*   **subinterfaces:** Virtual interfaces that are created on a physical interface. Subinterfaces are often used on routers to segment traffic or to provide multiple logical connections over a single physical link.
*   **switched port:** A physical port on a Layer 3 switch that is configured to act as a switch port. Switched ports are associated with a particular VLAN and are used to connect to end devices, such as PCs.
*   **switched virtual interface (SVI):** A virtual interface on a Layer 3 switch that represents a VLAN. SVIs are used to route traffic between VLANs.
*   **VLAN interface:** A logical interface on a switch that represents a VLAN. VLAN interfaces can be used to configure IP addresses and other parameters for a VLAN.
