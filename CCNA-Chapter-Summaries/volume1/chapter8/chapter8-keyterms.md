# Chapter 8: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs - Key Terms

This page provides a glossary of key terms introduced in Chapter 8 of the CCNA Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, related to Ethernet Virtual LANs (VLANs).

* **802.1Q:** The IEEE standard for VLAN tagging, used to identify frames belonging to different VLANs on a trunk link.
* **Access interface:** An interface configured to belong to a single VLAN, typically used to connect end devices like computers or printers.
* **Data VLAN:** A VLAN used to carry regular user data traffic.
* **Default VLAN:** VLAN 1; the default VLAN on Cisco switches, used for management traffic and to carry all untagged traffic on a trunk link.
* **Layer 3 switch:** A switch that can perform routing functions in addition to switching.
* **Native VLAN:** The VLAN assigned to untagged frames on a trunk link.
* **Static access interface:** An access interface that is manually assigned to a specific VLAN.
* **Trunk:** A link between two switches that carries traffic for multiple VLANs.
* **Trunk interface:** An interface configured to carry traffic for multiple VLANs.
* **Trunking administrative mode:** The configured mode of an interface for trunking, which can be access, dynamic, or trunk.
* **Trunking operational mode:** The actual operating mode of an interface for trunking, which can be access or trunk.
* **VLAN:** A virtual LAN; a logical grouping of devices on a network that simulates a separate physical LAN.
* **Voice VLAN:** A VLAN specifically configured to carry voice traffic, often with Quality of Service (QoS) settings optimized for voice.
* **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol):** A Cisco proprietary protocol used to manage VLAN configurations across multiple switches.
* **VTP transparent mode:** A VTP mode in which the switch does not participate in VTP domain updates but still forwards VTP advertisements.
