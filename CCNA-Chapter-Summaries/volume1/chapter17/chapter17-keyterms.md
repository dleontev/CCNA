*   **administrative distance (AD):** A number (1-255) used by a router to rate the trustworthiness of a routing information source. Lower AD values indicate more preferred routes.
*   **ARP table:** A table on a device that stores mappings between IP addresses and MAC addresses.
*   **connected route:** A route to a network that is directly connected to a router interface.
*   **default route:** A route that matches all packets, used to forward traffic to destinations not found in the routing table. Often referred to as the "gateway of last resort."
*   **floating static route:** A static route with a higher administrative distance than the primary route. It is used as a backup route if the primary route fails.
*   **host route:** A route to a specific host (individual IP address).
*   **network route:** A route to a network or subnet.
*   **next-hop router:** The IP address of the next router to which a packet should be forwarded on its way to the final destination.
*   **outgoing interface:** The interface on a router that a packet should be forwarded out of to reach its destination.
*   **routing table:** A table on a router that stores information about reachable networks, including the network address, subnet mask, next hop, and outgoing interface.
*   **static route:** A route that is manually configured by a network administrator.
