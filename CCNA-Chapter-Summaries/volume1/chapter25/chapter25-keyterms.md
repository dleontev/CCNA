# Chapter 25 Key Terms

*   **EIGRP version 6 (EIGRPv6):** The IPv6 version of the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP). It is a Cisco proprietary distance vector routing protocol that provides fast convergence and efficient use of bandwidth.
*   **IP version 6 (IPv6):** The next-generation Internet Protocol that is designed to replace IPv4. It has a larger address space, improved security features, and better support for mobile devices.
*   **IPv4 address exhaustion:** The depletion of available IPv4 addresses, which is a major reason for the transition to IPv6.
*   **OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3):** The IPv6 version of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol. It is a link-state routing protocol that provides fast convergence and scalability.
*   **prefix length:** The number of bits in the network portion of an IPv6 address. It is represented by a slash followed by a decimal number (e.g., `/64`).
*   **quartet:** A group of four hexadecimal digits in an IPv6 address.
*   **subnet prefix:** The portion of an IPv6 address that identifies the subnet to which the address belongs. The subnet prefix is the same for all addresses in the same subnet.
