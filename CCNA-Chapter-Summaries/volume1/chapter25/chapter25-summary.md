# Chapter 25: Fundamentals of IP Version 6

## Introduction to IPv6

*   IPv6 is the replacement protocol for IPv4.
*   IPv6 defines the same general functions as IPv4, but with different methods of implementing those functions.
*   IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, compared to IPv4 addresses, which are 32 bits long.
*   IPv6 has a number of advantages over IPv4, including a larger address space, improved security, and better support for mobile devices.

## IPv6 Addressing Formats and Conventions

*   IPv6 addresses are written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.
*   IPv6 addresses can be abbreviated by removing leading zeros and replacing consecutive zeros with a double colon.
*   The prefix length of an IPv6 address is a slash followed by a decimal number that indicates the number of bits in the prefix.
*   The IPv6 subnet prefix is the first part of the IPv6 address that is the same for all addresses in the same subnet.

## IPv6 Routing

*   IPv6 routing is similar to IPv4 routing, but with a few key differences.
*   IPv6 routers use the destination IPv6 address to make a forwarding decision.
*   IPv6 routers use a routing table to look up the destination IPv6 address.
*   IPv6 routing protocols are used to exchange routing information between routers.

## IPv6 Routing Protocols

*   IPv6 routing protocols are similar to IPv4 routing protocols, but with a few key differences.
*   IPv6 routing protocols use multicast messages to exchange routing information.
*   IPv6 routing protocols support a variety of metrics, including hop count and cost.

## Other IPv6 Features

*   IPv6 has a number of other features, including:
    *   Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
    *   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    *   Multicast
    *   Anycast
    *   Security
    *   Mobility
