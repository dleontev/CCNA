# Chapter 26 Key Terms

*   **global routing prefix:**  A portion of the IPv6 address space assigned to an organization by an Internet service provider (ISP) or a regional Internet registry (RIR). It is used to create globally routable IPv6 addresses for the organization's network.
*   **global unicast address:** An IPv6 address that is globally unique and routable on the Internet. It is used for communication between devices on different networks.
*   **interface ID (IID):** The 64-bit portion of an IPv6 address that identifies a specific interface on a device. It is typically generated from the device's MAC address.
*   **subnet ID (prefix ID):** A portion of an IPv6 address that identifies a specific subnet within a network. It is used to route traffic within the organization's network.
*   **subnet prefix:** The combination of the global routing prefix and the subnet ID. It identifies the specific subnet to which an IPv6 address belongs.
*   **subnet router anycast address:** An IPv6 address that is used to identify all routers on a specific subnet. It is used for routing protocols and other network services.
*   **ULA global ID:** A 40-bit randomly generated number that is used to create unique local addresses (ULAs). It ensures that ULAs from different organizations do not conflict.
*   **unique local address:** An IPv6 address that is similar to a private IPv4 address. It is not routable on the public Internet and is intended for use within a single organization or a small group of organizations.
