# Key Terms

*   **adjacent-layer interaction:** The process of communication between adjacent layers in a networking model on the same device. The lower layer provides a service to the upper layer. For example, the data link layer provides a service to the network layer by framing packets.
*   **de-encapsulation:** The reverse of encapsulation, where the headers and trailers are removed from a packet as it travels up the networking stack.
*   **encapsulation:** The process of adding control information (headers and sometimes trailers) to a packet as it travels down the networking stack.
*   **frame:** A data link layer Protocol Data Unit (PDU). Frames are used to transmit data on a local area network (LAN).
*   **networking model:** A conceptual framework that divides the network communication process into distinct layers. Each layer performs specific functions and interacts with the layers above and below it.
*   **packet:** A network layer PDU. Packets are used to transmit data across a network.
*   **same-layer interaction:** The process of communication between the same layers on different devices. For example, the network layer on one device communicates with the network layer on another device.
*   **segment:** A transport layer PDU. Segments are used to divide data into smaller units for transmission and to provide reliable communication between applications.
