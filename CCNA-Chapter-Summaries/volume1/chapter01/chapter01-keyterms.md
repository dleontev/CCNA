# Chapter 1: Introduction to TCP/IP Networking - Key Terms

This page provides a glossary of key terms introduced in Chapter 1 of the CCNA Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, related to the fundamentals of TCP/IP networking.

* **Adjacent-layer Interaction:** The communication and cooperation between consecutive layers within the same networking stack on a device.
* **De-encapsulation:** The reverse process of encapsulation, where control information (headers and trailers) is removed as data moves up the layers of a networking model.
* **Encapsulation:** The process of adding control information (headers and sometimes trailers) to data as it moves down the layers of a networking model.
* **Frame:** A Layer 2 data unit, containing the payload and control information necessary for transmission on a local network.
* **Networking Model:** A conceptual framework that standardizes network communication functions into a series of layers, each with specific responsibilities.
* **Packet:** A Layer 3 data unit, containing the payload and addressing information for routing across networks.
* **Same-layer Interaction:** The communication and cooperation between corresponding layers on different devices in a network.
* **Segment:** A Layer 4 data unit, responsible for providing reliable or unreliable delivery of data between applications.
