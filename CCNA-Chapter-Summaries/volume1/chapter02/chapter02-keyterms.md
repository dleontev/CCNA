# Key Terms

*   **10BASE-T:** An Ethernet standard that specifies data transmission at 10 Mbps over unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling.
*   **100BASE-T:** An Ethernet standard that specifies data transmission at 100 Mbps over UTP cabling. Also known as Fast Ethernet.
*   **1000BASE-T:** An Ethernet standard that specifies data transmission at 1 Gbps over UTP cabling. Also known as Gigabit Ethernet.
*   **auto-MDIX:** A feature that allows a switch to automatically detect the type of cable that is connected to a port and configure the port accordingly.
*   **broadcast address:** An address that is used to send a frame to all devices on a LAN.
*   **cladding:** The outer layer of a fiber-optic cable that reflects light back into the core.
*   **core:** The inner layer of a fiber-optic cable that carries the light signals.
*   **crossover cable:** A type of Ethernet cable that is used to connect two devices of the same type, such as two switches.
*   **electromagnetic interference (EMI):** A type of interference that can affect the transmission of data over copper cables.
*   **Ethernet:** A family of networking technologies that are commonly used in LANs.
*   **Ethernet address:** A 48-bit address that is used to uniquely identify a device on an Ethernet LAN. Also known as a MAC address.
