# Chapter 02: Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs - Key Terms

This page provides a glossary of key terms introduced in Chapter 2 of the CCNA Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, related to Ethernet LAN fundamentals.

* **10BASE-T:** An Ethernet standard that uses twisted-pair cabling and supports speeds of 10 Mbps.
* **100BASE-T:** An Ethernet standard, also known as Fast Ethernet, that uses twisted-pair cabling and supports speeds of 100 Mbps.
* **1000BASE-T:** An Ethernet standard, also known as Gigabit Ethernet, that uses twisted-pair cabling and supports speeds of 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps).
* **Auto-MDIX:** A feature that automatically detects the required cable type (straight-through or crossover) and configures the interface accordingly.
* **Broadcast address:** An address used to send a message to all devices on a network.
* **Cladding:** The outer layer of a fiber-optic cable that reflects light back into the core.
* **Core:** The inner layer of a fiber-optic cable that transmits light.
* **Crossover cable:** A type of twisted-pair cable used to connect devices of the same type (e.g., switch to switch).
* **Electromagnetic interference (EMI):** Disturbance that affects an electrical circuit due to electromagnetic radiation emitted from an external source.
* **Ethernet:** A family of networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LANs).
* **Ethernet address:** A 48-bit address used to uniquely identify a device on an Ethernet network, also known as a MAC address.
* **Ethernet frame:** The Layer 2 data unit used in Ethernet networks, containing the payload and control information.
* **Ethernet link:** The physical connection between two Ethernet devices.
* **Ethernet port:** A physical interface on a device used to connect to an Ethernet network.
* **Fast Ethernet:**  See 100BASE-T.
* **Fiber-optic cable:** A type of cable that uses light to transmit data, offering high bandwidth and low signal loss.
* **Frame Check Sequence (FCS):** A field in the Ethernet frame used for error detection.
* **Gigabit Ethernet:** See 1000BASE-T.
* **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):** A professional organization that develops standards for electrical and electronic technologies, including Ethernet.
* **MAC address:**  See Ethernet address.
* **Multimode fiber:** A type of fiber-optic cable that allows multiple light paths, suitable for shorter distances.
* **Network interface card (NIC):** A hardware component that connects a device to a network.
* **RJ-45:** A standard connector used with twisted-pair cabling.
* **Single-mode fiber:** A type of fiber-optic cable that allows only one light path, suitable for longer distances.
* **Straight-through cable:** A type of twisted-pair cable used to connect devices of different types (e.g., switch to computer).
* **Transceiver:** A device that converts electrical signals to optical signals and vice versa, used in fiber-optic communication.
* **Unicast address:** An address used to send a message to a single device on a network.
* **Wired LAN:** A LAN that uses physical cables to connect devices.
* **Wireless LAN:** A LAN that uses wireless communication technologies to connect devices.
