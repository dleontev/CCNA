# Key Terms

*   **10/100:** Refers to an Ethernet interface that can operate at either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.
*   **10/100/1000:** Refers to an Ethernet interface that can operate at 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps).
*   **auto-MDIX:** A feature that allows a switch to automatically detect the type of cable that is connected to a port (straight-through or crossover) and configure the port accordingly.
*   **autonegotiation:** A process that allows two Ethernet devices to automatically negotiate the speed and duplex mode of their connection.
*   **duplex mismatch:** A situation where two connected Ethernet devices are operating in different duplex modes (one in half duplex, the other in full duplex). This can lead to significant performance issues.
*   **full duplex:** A mode of Ethernet communication where a device can transmit and receive data simultaneously.
*   **half duplex:** A mode of Ethernet communication where a device can either transmit or receive data at a time, but not both simultaneously.
*   **late collisions:** Collisions that occur after the first 512 bits of a frame have been transmitted. Late collisions are often a symptom of a duplex mismatch.
*   **parallel detection:** A method used by Ethernet devices to detect collisions. When a device detects that another device is transmitting at the same time, it stops transmitting and sends a jam signal.
