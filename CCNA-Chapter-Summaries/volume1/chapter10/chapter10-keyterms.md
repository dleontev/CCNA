# Chapter 10: RSTP and EtherChannel Configuration - Key Terms

This page provides a glossary of key terms introduced in Chapter 10 of the CCNA Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, related to Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) and EtherChannel.

* **Channel-group:** The interface command used to create an EtherChannel.
* **EtherChannel:** A technology that combines multiple physical links into a single logical link, also known as link aggregation.  Provides increased bandwidth and redundancy.
* **EtherChannel load distribution:**  Methods used to distribute traffic across the physical links within an EtherChannel.
* **LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol):** An open standard protocol used to negotiate and manage EtherChannels.
* **PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol):** A Cisco proprietary protocol used to negotiate and manage EtherChannels.
* **PortChannel:** The logical interface that represents the combined physical links in an EtherChannel.
* **PVST+ (Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus):** A Cisco enhancement to STP that runs a separate instance of STP for each VLAN.
* **Rapid PVST+ (Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus):** A Cisco enhancement to RSTP that provides faster convergence for PVST+.
* **System ID extension:** A field in the BPDU used by PVST+ to include the VLAN ID, allowing for per-VLAN spanning tree instances.
