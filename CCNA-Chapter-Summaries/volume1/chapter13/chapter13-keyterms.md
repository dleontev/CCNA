# Chapter 13 Key Terms

*   **binary mask:** A subnet mask represented as a 32-bit binary number with 1s representing the network and subnet bits and 0s representing the host bits (e.g., `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`).
*   **CIDR mask:**  A subnet mask represented using CIDR notation, which is a slash followed by the number of bits in the network and subnet portion of the address (e.g., `/24`).
*   **classful addressing:** An older method of IP address allocation that divides addresses into classes (A, B, and C) with fixed-length network IDs and default subnet masks.
*   **classless addressing:** A more flexible method of IP address allocation that uses CIDR notation and allows for variable-length subnet masks (VLSM).
*   **decimal mask:**  A subnet mask represented in dotted-decimal notation, with each octet representing 8 bits of the binary mask (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
*   **dotted-decimal notation (DDN):** The standard way of representing IP addresses, where four decimal numbers (0-255) are separated by periods (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
*   **prefix mask:** See CIDR mask.
