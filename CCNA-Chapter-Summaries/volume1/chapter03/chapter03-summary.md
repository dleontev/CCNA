# Chapter 3: Fundamentals of WANs and IP Routing

## Wide-Area Networks

### Leased-Line WANs

*   Leased lines are a type of WAN technology that uses a dedicated circuit between two sites.
*   Leased lines can be used to connect LANs together.
*   Leased lines are typically used to connect a remote site to a central site.
*   Leased lines can be used to connect two remote sites together.
*   Leased lines are typically full duplex.
*   Leased lines can be used with a variety of data-link protocols, including HDLC and PPP.

### Ethernet as a WAN Technology

*   Ethernet can be used as a WAN technology.
*   Ethernet WANs use fiber optic cables.
*   Ethernet WANs can be used to connect LANs together.
*   Ethernet WANs are typically used to connect a remote site to a central site.
*   Ethernet WANs can be used to connect two remote sites together.
*   Ethernet WANs are typically full duplex.

## IP Routing

### How Routers Route IP Packets

*   Routers use the destination IP address to make a forwarding decision.
*   Routers use a routing table to look up the destination IP address.
*   The routing table entry for the destination IP address tells the router which interface to forward the packet out of.
*   The routing table entry may also tell the router the next hop IP address.

### How IP Addressing Helps IP Routing

*   IP addresses are grouped into subnets.
*   Subnets are used to identify which devices are on the same LAN.
*   Routers use subnets to make routing decisions.

### How IP Routing Protocols Help IP Routing

*   IP routing protocols are used to exchange routing information between routers.
*   Routing protocols allow routers to learn about all of the subnets in the network.
*   Routing protocols allow routers to choose the best path to each subnet.

## Other Network Layer Features

### DNS

*   DNS is used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.
*   DNS is a distributed database.
*   DNS uses a hierarchy of servers.

### ARP

*   ARP is used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.
*   ARP is a LAN protocol.
*   ARP uses broadcast messages.

### ICMP

*   ICMP is used to send error messages and other control messages.
*   ICMP is a network layer protocol.
*   ICMP is used by the ping command.
