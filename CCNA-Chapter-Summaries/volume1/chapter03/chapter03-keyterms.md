# Chapter 03: Fundamentals of WANs and IP Routing - Key Terms

This page provides a glossary of key terms introduced in Chapter 3 of the CCNA Official Cert Guide, Volume 1, related to Wide Area Networks (WANs) and IP routing fundamentals.

* **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** A protocol used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.
* **Default router (default gateway):** The router that a device uses to send traffic to destinations outside its local network.
* **DNS (Domain Name System):** A system that translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.
* **Ethernet Line Service (E-Line):** A point-to-point Ethernet connection that provides dedicated bandwidth between two locations.
* **Ethernet WAN:** A WAN technology that uses Ethernet standards and protocols over a wider geographical area.
* **HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control):** A bit-oriented synchronous data link layer protocol commonly used in WANs.
* **Hostname:** A human-readable name assigned to a device on a network.
* **IP address:** A unique numerical address assigned to a device on a network.
* **IP network:** A logical group of devices that share the same network address.
* **IP packet:** A Layer 3 data unit that carries data across networks.
* **IP subnet:** A logical subdivision of an IP network.
* **Leased line:** A dedicated communication line rented from a telecommunications provider.
* **Ping:** A network diagnostic tool used to test the reachability of a device on a network.
* **Routing protocol:** A protocol used by routers to exchange routing information and build routing tables.
* **Routing table:** A data table stored in a router that lists the routes to different networks.
* **Serial interface:** A type of interface commonly used in WAN connections, transmitting data one bit at a time.
* **Subnetting:** The process of dividing an IP network into smaller subnetworks.
* **Telco (Telecommunications company):** A company that provides telecommunications services.
* **Wide-area network (WAN):** A network that spans a large geographical area, connecting LANs across cities, countries, or continents.
